The place to start for making a component library.


### Hi!

This repo is a starting place for a component library. Simply clone this and add what you want.

### Depandencies

The depandencies are add completely based on opinion. There are other ways to accomplish this but, these are some of the more popular tools in the industry. The main goal here is that if you run into problems you hopefully wont be the first one and can google for an answer.

### What's in here?

In here you will see the dev build tools and dev tools. You will not see frame works like React, Angular, Vue, ect. You also wont see css frame work decisions here. This allows every one to start here and make choices like that based on their oppinions. It is recommended to use storybook for the testing environment but it is not nessacary, and therefore not included at this stage.

### Philosophy

Everthing in here is based on atomic design. The component library will only consist of atoms, molecules and organisms. Anythig beyond that in atomic design is contextual and does really belong here. These these begin to be to related to implimentation and not really sharable. Think about it this way, if you were to open source your library would it make sense for you to share all the pieces in there. The moment you identify pieces that dont make sense you should find a place for them else where.
